Great! Since you're starting with just **managing rooms** in an inventory app for hotels or Airbnbs, let's treat this like a real database planning exercise.

We’ll define:

1. **Entities (tables)**
2. **Fields for each table**
3. **Relationships between tables**
4. **Constraints**

---

## 🧱 1. **Entities and Fields**

### ✅ `room_types`

> General categorization of rooms (e.g., Standard, Deluxe, Suite)

| Field       | Type    | Notes                     |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| id          | integer | Primary key               |
| name        | string  | Unique (e.g., "Standard") |
| description | text    | Optional                  |
| base\_price | decimal | Per night (optional)      |

---

### ✅ `rooms`

> Individual room units in a hotel or Airbnb listing

| Field          | Type        | Notes                                      |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| id             | integer     | Primary key                                |
| room\_number   | string      | E.g., "101", "B12" — must be unique        |
| name           | string      | Optional (e.g., "Ocean View Room")         |
| status         | enum/string | e.g., `available`, `booked`, `maintenance` |
| room\_type\_id | integer     | Foreign key → `room_types.id`              |
| floor          | integer     | Optional, for hotels                       |
| created\_at    | timestamp   | Auto-set on creation                       |

---

### ✅ `room_features` (optional for MVP)

> List of features available in rooms (TV, A/C, balcony, etc.)

| Field | Type    | Notes                    |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| id    | integer | Primary key              |
| name  | string  | e.g., "Air Conditioning" |

---

### ✅ `room_feature_assignments` (join table)

> Many-to-many relation between rooms and features

| Field       | Type                    | Notes                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| room\_id    | integer                 | FK → `rooms.id`         |
| feature\_id | integer                 | FK → `room_features.id` |
| PRIMARY KEY | (room\_id, feature\_id) | Composite Key           |

---

## 🔗 2. **Relationships**

* A **room belongs to one room type**, and a **room type has many rooms** (One-to-Many)
* A **room can have many features**, and a **feature can belong to many rooms** (Many-to-Many)

---

## ⚠️ 3. **Constraints to Enforce**

| Table                      | Constraint                  | Description                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `rooms`                    | `UNIQUE(room_number)`       | No duplicate rooms                       |
| `rooms`                    | `FOREIGN KEY(room_type_id)` | Must reference existing room\_type       |
| `room_feature_assignments` | Composite primary key       | Prevents duplicate room-feature entries  |
| `room_feature_assignments` | Foreign keys                | Must reference existing room and feature |

---

## 🔄 4. **ERD Summary (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**

```plaintext
room_types (1) ────< (∞) rooms
rooms (∞) ────< (∞) room_feature_assignments >──── (∞) room_features
```

---

## 🧠 Example in Plain English:

* Room 101 is a **Standard Room** (room\_type).
* Room 101 has the following features: **Wi-Fi**, **Air Conditioning**, **Balcony**.
* “Standard Room” is a type defined in `room_types` with a base price of \$80/night.

Would you like me to now convert this into SQL schema or generate the seed data/Express route structure for it?
